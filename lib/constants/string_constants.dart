    'Lake Oeschinen lies at the foot of the Bl√ºemlisalp in the Bernese '
    'Alps. Situated 1,578 meters above sea level, it is one of the '
    'larger Alpine Lakes. A gondola ride from Kandersteg, followed by a '
    'half-hour walk through pastures and pine forest, leads you to the '
    'lake, which warms to 20 degrees Celsius in the summer. Activities '
    'enjoyed here include rowing, and riding the summer toboggan run.';
